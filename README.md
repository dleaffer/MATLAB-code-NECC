This example illustrates how to measure the light sensitive analog voltage from a photoresistor circuit connected to Pin 0 of an Arduino Uno.
The example then applies three types of calculations in real-time to determine if the current voltage reading signifies motion.
Using a pre-recorded dataset, the data is further processed in MATLAB to categorize the motion.

This example requires the user to first install the MATLAB Support Pacakge for Arduino Hardware which is available here:
